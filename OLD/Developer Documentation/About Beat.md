# About Beat

Hello, stranger.

A lot of the code in this project was written with very limited skills in programming. You'll see unused methods, weird duct-tape solutions and unfinished stuff here and there. Dread lightly.

Originally, 99% of the code was put inside the massive Document class, and later, as I got a bit more experienced, I started modularizing the code. It's still a mess, but at least there is *some* structure to it now. I've tried explaining and commenting my most excentric practices, but I'm often baffled myself too.    

As I'm writing this, situation in Europe is becoming very tense and it's completely possible I won't be here when you read this. There are threats of an all-out nuclear war, and the country I'm currently living in is probably next in line to be attacked. I hope Beat will live on after I'm gone, in some for or another, so I've started documenting how the app actually works.


# Overview

At the heart of Beat is the `ContinunousFountainParser`. Every change made to `BeatTextView` is parsed, and the parser itself uses `Line` objects to store information about individual lines -- their position (index), string and formatted ranges.

Beat is **not** a WYSIWYG editor, and it would be very hard to convert it to one. PDF export and printing are actually HTML documents, which are preprocessed and paginated. Parser does the preprocesing, and *BeatPagination* instance splits stuff across multiple pages and is the most complicated and messed-up code in the whole project.

If you are planning on developing Beat further, I'd suggest you write a completely new screenplay rendering engine using native Cocoa drawing. Do take a look at the exporting code, though, because it's really something to marvel. It's overly complicated, everything happens in multiple steps and overall makes no fucking sense.

Because of its legacy as a fork, the app is written in Objective C. Lately, I started to experiment with Swift. There are some classes that have been either written in Swift from scratch, or have been converted from objc. I still don't get Swift at all.

There are some parts that have been completely commented out. Sometimes I've written something like *"For generations to come"* or *"And die Nachgeborenen"* next to them to make it clear that it's a planned, new solution rather than something that has been deprecated.

*Update in 2023:* A native Cocoa rendering was implemented, just in time to be obliterated by TextKit 2, which is very sparsely documented and difficult to work if you'd like to move TextKit 1 stuff there. The HTML renderer code still exists, and is used by the iPadOS version, so it's possible we need to go back there one day. Unfortunately with HTML export on macOS, the installed printer (or the lack of one) can affect paper margins, so you won't get a reliable output. I'm not sure if this is still the case in Sonoma, but I'm afraid it is.  


# Document Model

## Document

`Document` is a massive class, and I'm sorry for that. It is that because of legacy reasons (meaning me being bad at Objective C) and I'm not proud of it. I've started moving a lot of stuff to an OS-agnostic class called `BeatDocumentBaseController`, which is the superclass of both macOS and iOS implementations of the actual document view.

Start from `windowControllerDidLoadNib` and work from there. Document loading is throttled using chained GC dispatches, and might be a bit confusing at first.

From there, editing a document is this constant three-way ping-pong of `BeatTextView`, `Document` and `ContinuousFountainParser`. It's often unclear what happens in `BeatTextView`, and what happens in `Document`. 

Rendering and text view specific things (such as displaying autocorrect dropdowns) are handled by the text view, while `Document` listens to changes in the text, sends them to parser and after parsing, asks another class to format the text. The document also contains a lot of `IBAction`s, though most of them are just stubs forwarding them somewhere else.

`shouldChangeTextInRange` parses the possible change **before** it is actually displayed, which means the parser knows the change ahead of time. Formatting is applied (based on parser data) when the text view calls `textDidChange`.
 


## Parser

`ContinuousFountainParser` is based on the work of Hendrik Noeller, though I've rewritten ost of it since. I figured out how to optimize quite a few things, and also streamlined some of the stuff. And made some of it more complicated.

Parser **does not** use regexes, but parses changes on char level (using `unichar` arrays) and it might look a bit weird at times, but is super fast. I've tried commenting the more confusing parts, but probably haven't covered the particular thing that confuses you.

The parser is used both while editing (live/continuous parsing) and when exporting and loading documents (static parsing). It's important to ensure that everything gets parsed correctly in both situations, because, in theory, Fountain files should be parsed from bottom to top, and here we're always parsing downwards. We also need to perform lookbacks and correct our parses based on other surrounding lines -- and in many cases, reparse all of those affected lines.

As the parser is the oldest part of Beat, originating from somebody else's work, there are also unused, weird methods lingering here and there. All apologies. 
    

## Line

`Line`s contain all the relevant parsed data. It's mostly used for storing the parsed formatting ranges, line type etc. but line object also has some methods for joining two lines and converting their contents for further formatting, such as returning an attributed string for exporting to both HTML and Final Draft XML. 

`Line` contents are changed by the parser, so you can't change *editor* contents by changing *line object* string content, which is frustrating at times. However, I *did* experiment with having a parser delegate for each line, and the parser knowing its host document, so it could relay the change forward. This didn't really make too much sense, though, and led to circulal logic.

Line types are simple objc enums. 


## Outine

Parser also creates an outline, with all the structural elements: scene headings, synopsis lines and sections. The resulting objects, clumsily named `OutlineScene`s don't *actually* refer to anything in the document, but rather work as intermediate data which gathers a lot of stuff into the same basket. They know the line which represents the outline element in the screenplay, position and title, and can fetch their length and other stuff, such as associated storylines and beats. 

I recommend reading the plugin wiki (https://github.com/lmparppei/BeatPlugins/wiki) which has document model examples. They are in JavaScript, but basic logic still applies.


# Exporting

## Pagination

Screenplay pagination is pretty complicated and it has a ton of rules and conventions, and it's even harder when working with parsed, non-WYSIWYG content.

`BeatPagination` (called using `BeatPaginationManager`) does the heavy lifting, but note that *everything* happens in a dark room without lights. The pagination receives page size and custom stylesheet info (`beatCSS`), and then tries to figure out what could fit on a page, without actually seeing anything.

The advantage is that it's quite fast, even when paginating the whole document from scratch, and it allows using the same data in both iOS and macOS. On iOS, the results are rendered to HTML, which *doesn't* use the same custom stylesheets, so the CSS styles have to be made similar by hand. It's a mess, I know.

Pagination class also has an API for getting page numbers in the editor. In the future, we might actually have quasi-WYSIWYG capabilities using that data.

`BeatPagination` represents a single pagination pass, `BeatPaginationPage` holds elements for a single page, and `BeatPaginationBlock` are basically paragraphs/elements on a page. For example, one block of dialogue or a single paragraph are both represented by `BeatPaginationBlock`. When going through elements, we'll also use `BeatPaginationBlockGroup` which binds multiple blocks together to keep them on the same page. Blocks know their height and styles, and pages handle vertical spacing.
 
 The system is quite reliable, but as it happens in the background, it can sometimes runs into weird threading issues, and there are obviously a lot of cases I haven't taken into account. Two-page parenthesis within 10-page dialogue block? No idea how it would behave, I haven't tested. I'm all for dooing crazy and innovative stuff, but Beat always isn't.
 

## Rendering




# Plugins

Plugins work through `JavaScriptCore`. It's a convoluted system, but the actual plugins are relatively simple. They run using a single class, `BeatPlugin`, and most relevant classes have `JSExports` protocols to make them compatible with the plugin API.

Plugin Library downloads stuff from a hard-coded GitHub repository (see exact URL in the class). There is a chance that the plugins could do nefarious things, so all of those plugins are reviewed and approved by me, but Beat can run whatever you feed it. **Supply-chain attack is possible**, but the plugin repo is separate from main app repo, and I can kill plugin support via the release if something bad happens. 

To be able to provide plugins to end users in the future, you need access to that repository. There is a script called `create_json.sh` in plugin repo, which can be used to package all plugins and create the external JSON file, whic is used by Plugin Library to serve the data.   

Most plugin API methods are documented in the GitHub repository Wiki.


# Beat File Format

## Fountain

Beat document conforms to the Fountain markup specification: http://fountain.io/

The files are saved using `.fountain` extension to maintain compatibility with other Fountain editors, such as Slugline, Logline and Highland. Everything should be readable in any other app, save for ranges marked for removal. They appear as plain text. Beat-specific stuff, such as revisions and tagging, are also unavailable in other apps. 

Beat is a bit more forgiving with some elements, such as scene headings. The parser accepts lowercase scene headings (ie. *int. home*), although they are converted to uppercase when saving, except for forced headings.


## Document Settings

At the end of file, there is a special data block, which contains document settings, things like caret position and character genders, but also all of the revision and tagging ranges.

````
/* If you're seeing this, you can remove the following stuff - BEAT:
{ json data }
END_BEAT*/
````

`BeatDocumentSettings` parses this JSON block back into an `NSMutableDictionary`, which contains the document settings. Upon saving, Beat calls a method which creates a JSON string out of the dictionary.

If encoded correctly, document settings can contain almost any sort of information, but I recommend using it only for text and numerical data. Note that many Objective C structures are not directly convertable to JSON, so `NSDictionary` serializes them as arrays. For example, `NSRange` becomes something like `[0, 12]`.

There are standard keywords for certain settings, which you can see in the class itself, but the block can contain other settings too. For example, plugins can write their own settings into the file, usually prefixed by plugin name, ie. `"PluginName: setting"`.


## Future Considerations

As you might notice, TextBundle is included in the project. We *could* have a Beat-specific file format, which could include any sort of attachments and data along with the screenplay, and even multiple versions of the document. However, using plain-text UTF-8 files makes things much easier for the user, and adds to the trust that your files are actually readable on any computer.

It would of course be possible to support both plain Fountain files and `.beat` (TextBundle) wrappers, and that might be the way to go. Just alert the user that they will need to save the project in a wrapper file format when they include data that isn't convenient to save at the end of a plain-text screenplay.  


# Post-mortem

Beat began as a personal project, and became something else. I hope I'm still here and keep on developing the app on my spare time. There are many things I could have done with the hundreds or thousands of hours I put into this app -- spend time with my loved ones, take long walks or plant flowers and trees -- but I'm glad I did what I did.

The app has made it possible to interact with great people, provide the best screenwriting experience I've had, and also write stuff of my own. I've enjoyed most of the time I've spent with Beat. I began working on it when I was recovering from an abusive relationship, and learning to code got my thoughts away from the fear and post-traumatic stress I was experiencing.

I hope that, you who found this file, will take on Beat as a passion project of your own. I'll keep on expanding this "documentation" and commenting the code to clarify my esoteric practices.
