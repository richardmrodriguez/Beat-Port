 This is an embedded split view controller, and essentially some sort of a hack.
 Dread lightly. This separates the actual editor view from document view, which could
 cause some memory issues, but ... hasn't yet.

/**
 
 i'm 39 and amazed to be alive
    remembering how
   i once planned on dying
      maybe 15 years ago
     and went to say my farewells
 to
 parents
 grandparents
 my ex lover i still loved (still do)
 best friends
 coworkers
 the river
 the sea
 my instruments
 our band
 our records
 the rocky fence
 
 sat with them and never said a word
 never hinted  about what's to come
 i was brighter and easier than ever
 
 my home would become my tomb
 and i was ready
 until i realized i had too many things to do
 didn't want to leave others in trouble
 so i kept on working...
 
 and at some point
 i no longer dreamt about it
 or planned it
 
 i have it easy
 no bombs above my head
 no dead family in among rubbles
 the only one that used to want to kill me
 was me
 and somehow we made a truce
 
 no matter how fragile the pace may be
 i'm savouring
 every moment.
