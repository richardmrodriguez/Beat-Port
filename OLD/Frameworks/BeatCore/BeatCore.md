#  BeatCore

This framework provides cross-platform classes, most of which work using just Foundation. Some have target conditionals and differing implementations for either macOS or iOS. 

`BeatCore` currently includes these classes:

- User defaults
- Beat color palette
- Tagging
- Revisions
- Reviews (with UI components, too)
- Layout manager (cross-platform compatible)
- Localization helper (actual localization files still reside in their respective app bundles)

Later, both parsing and pagination will probably be included in the same framework, but for now, they are separated.
